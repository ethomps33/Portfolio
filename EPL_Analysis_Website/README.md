# Web-Design_Challenge
Background:

In this assignment I was tasked with building a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from a Project 1. To do this I will be using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

The website needed to consist of a total of 7 different pages:

* Landing page
    I was taked with making a landing page where the project was explained. The landing page was also required to include links to the visualization pages. 

* Visualization pages
    4 Visualization pages where required. Each should have a descriptive title and heading tag, the visualization for comparison, and a paragraph describing the visualization and its significance.

* Comparisons page
    1 comparison page that contains all of visualizations on one page. The page needs to use a Bootstrap grid which is 2 visualizations across on screens medium and larger and one across on x-small and small screens.

* Data page
    1 data page that displays the a responsive table containing the data used and the visualizations. The table must be a Bootstrap component and the data must come from exporting a .csv file a HTML or converting it to HTML.

The website is required to be at the top of every page and have a navigation bar. The Navbar should have the name of the site on the left and returns the user to the landing page from any page. It should also contain a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar with the name "Plots" with links to each visualization page. There should be 2 more text links on the right for the "Comparisons" and "Data" pages. Lastly the website was required to be deployed with GitHub pages.
